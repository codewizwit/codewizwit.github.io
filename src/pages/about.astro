    <!-- Act 1: The Story -->
    <section class="section-cream section" aria-labelledby="act1-heading">
      <div class="container container-narrow">
        <p class="label label-gold">Act I</p>
        <h2 id="act1-heading">The story</h2>
        <div class="prose">
          <p>
            I grew up in six countries before settling in the US. Taiwan, Latvia,
            Czech Republic, England, Scotland, Poland. My father scaled broadband
            infrastructure across Europe and Asia. He built the connective tissue
            that made the internet possible for millions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm doing the same for AI: building the ethical and practical
            frameworks that will determine whether it serves people or replaces them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I studied Media and Design at DePaul University in Chicago. I
            bartended for years. The service industry taught me empathy as an
            operational skill: reading people, understanding needs, solving
            problems in real-time. Those skills transferred to engineering more
            directly than any CS lecture could.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then COVID hit. I got furloughed. I invested my life savings in
            the UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp. I received my offer at Vanguard the
            day I graduated.
          </p>
          <p>
            That pivot wasn't reckless. It was a calculated bet on myself. And
            it paid off.

    <!-- Act 2: The Philosophy -->
    <section class="section-dark section" aria-labelledby="act2-heading">

        <p class="label" style="color: var(--color-gray-light);">Act II</p>
        <h2 id="act2-heading" style="color: var(--color-cream);">The philosophy</h2>
        <div class="prose" style="color: var(--color-gray-light);">
          <p>
            "No Human Left Behind" isn't a tagline. It's a tension I live with daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love AI. I'm a power user. It's transformed how I work, what I
            can build, how fast I can ship. I want others to experience that
            acceleration.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I'm deeply aware of the damage it can cause. To jobs, to
            creativity, to human connection. I've struggled with this. It's
            not resolved.
          </p>
          <p>
            That tension is the engine. Not anti-AI doomerism. Not uncritical
            hype. Something harder: using the thing I'm worried about,
            responsibly, while helping others do the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Senior Software Engineer in AI Enablement at Vanguard, I
            coach four teams on AI adoption, mentor junior engineers, and
            drive culture with a responsible AI lens. The philosophy isn't
            just a belief. It's operationalized. It's literally the job.

            Music: everything spanning hip-hop to doo-wop. Food: I believe the
            best conversations happen over good meals and the best ideas spark
            from great snacks. Sci-fi: I read it to think about the future we're
            building. Design: a DePaul Media and Design grad who brings visual
            thinking to technical problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring structure to chaos, energy to meetings, and intention to
            process improvements. Known for making teams stronger through
            collaboration, not just code.
