        "No Human Left Behind" is a commitment, and a tension I live with daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love AI. I'm a power user. It's transformed the way I think,
        build, and create. I want others to experience that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm deeply aware of the damage it can cause. To jobs, to
        creativity, to human connection. I've struggled with this. It's
        not resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        That tension is my engine. I take everything that keeps me up at
        night about AI and build it into frameworks, tools, and ways of
        working that keep humans at the center of AI adoption.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an AI Enablement Engineer, I coach engineering teams on how to
        build with AI effectively and responsibly, while shaping the direction of
        engineering culture at scale. This mission is at the center of the job: building a
        future where technology, ethics, and humanity move forward
        together, with no human left behind.
