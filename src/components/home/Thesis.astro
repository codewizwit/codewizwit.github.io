        "No Human Left Behind" is a commitment, and a tension I live with daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love AI. I'm a power user. It's transformed how I work, what I can
        build, how I think, and how I create. It hasn't just made me faster.
        It's enhanced my creativity and entire process. I want others to
        experience that.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I'm deeply aware of the damage it can cause. To jobs, to
        creativity, to human connection. I've struggled with this. It's
        not resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        That tension is the engine. Something harder than doomerism or
        hype: using the thing I'm worried about,
        responsibly, while helping others do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an AI Enablement Engineer at Vanguard, I coach teams
        on AI adoption, mentor junior engineers, and drive culture with
        a responsible AI lens. The philosophy isn't just a belief. It's
        operationalized. It's literally the job.
