*The long way up. From cable lines to code.*

*Published on what would have been my dad's 69th birthday. A story about the lessons that built us both.*

## The Long Way Up

My dad didn't have two pennies to rub together growing up.

He was raised by an Italian immigrant mother on the west side of Chicago with three siblings. His father left and started another family down the street. There wasn't money or privilege. Only noise, hustle, and survival.

He barely made it through high school. College wasn't an option. He started climbing poles, installing cable lines, and learning how systems really worked.

What he had was drive. He learned fast, made friends everywhere, and knew how to make people like him.

That mix of curiosity, confidence, and street smarts carried him far. He worked across Europe, consulting on broadband systems, and eventually became VP of Taiwan Broadband Communications.

When he was offered CEO, he could have coasted. Instead, he retired on his own terms.

He went from blue collar to white collar by instinct and ambition. No degree. No safety net. Just persistence and connection.

That same mix of curiosity and courage took our family across continents. From Chicago to Europe to Taiwan. He carried the message of a connected future long before it was mainstream.

He believed that technology could bring people together, and he dedicated his career to making that real across the globe.

That belief, that tech should connect, not divide, is the same one that drives me today as I build networks of code and conversation.

Different tools. Same mission. Make sure innovation serves people, not just progress.

## The Lesson

He had a really good run with the money for a while, and we all had a blast. But it didn't last.

That's what happens when no one ever teaches first-generation success how to keep what they earn.

He never started over, but he passed the torch to me.

I watched, listened, and learned.

When it was my turn, I ran with it in my own way.

That is the real inheritance. Not wealth or connections, but example.

## Built, Not Born

I took a different path, but the same approach.

Today, I am a Software Engineer but my story started behind a bar instead of behind a keyboard.

Service work was fast, unpredictable, and social. It taught me to read people, empathize, stay adaptable, and move quickly when the situation changed. Those skills turned out to be perfect for software engineering.

Like him, I learned how to move between worlds. From service to systems. From blue collar to white collar. By staying curious, working hard, and learning the rules by observing the room.

I inherited his go-getter attitude and his way with people.

Then COVID hit, and I was furloughed.

Instead of waiting for the world to fix itself, I taught myself how to code. I invested my life savings in a self-guided bootcamp course and night after night, I watched tutorials, broke things, rebuilt them, and kept going until I could call myself an engineer.

It was the same instinct he had. Make something from nothing. Learn your way forward.

Neither of us were handed opportunity. We built it.

And we both learned that ambition means taking the long way when it is the only way.

## What I Carry Forward

We both built systems that connect people.

Different tools. Same philosophy. Build well. Build honestly. Remember where you came from.

That is what I mean by built, not born.

It is about care, craft, the drive, and the will to keep learning.

## For My Dad

Wayne Kelstrom, who showed me that ambition means nothing without integrity, and that building something that lasts starts with knowing what matters most.

Happy Birthday, Dad. I love you. Rest in peace.

Your story built mine.
