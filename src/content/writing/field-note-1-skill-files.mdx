Three hours.

Three hours debating whether files should be named `user-profile.component.ts` or `userProfile.component.ts`.

Three hours that could have been spent building features, fixing bugs, or literally anything else.

And at the end? Someone says: "We should document this."

Narrator: They did not document it.

Six months later, a new developer asks in Slack: "How do we name component files?"

The cycle begins again.

---

## The Real Problem

Your team has standards. They live in:
- Someone's head (usually the senior dev)
- That one Notion page nobody updates
- PR comments repeated ad nauseam
- Slack threads that scroll into oblivion
- "The way we've always done it"

Standards exist. They're just invisible.

And making them visible? That requires meetings, wikis, documentation no one reads.

So we don't. And the cycle continues.

---

## AI Can Write Code, But Only Developers Can Decide What It Means

That's from [Dispatch №13](/writing/dispatch-13-ai-mandate), where I wrote about reclaiming developer agency in the age of AI mandates.

This is what that looks like in practice.

Not AI generating code. Not AI making decisions. AI helping your team discover the standards you already have, so you can decide what matters.

---

## Enter: Skill Files

Claude Code skill files are markdown documents that turn your team's implicit knowledge into automated guidance.

They live in `.claude/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/`.

Structure:

```markdown
---
name: team-typescript-standards
description: When to use this skill
---

# Your Standards Here
[Rules, examples, rationale your team agreed on]
```

Claude reads them automatically. Applies them when relevant.

No commands. No flags. Just works.

**The key difference**: These aren't AI-generated best practices from the internet. These are YOUR team's patterns, YOUR decisions, YOUR context.

AI discovers. Humans decide. Always.

---

## How It Works (Without Another 3-Hour Meeting)

### Step 1: AI Discovers, Humans Decide

Instead of debating, ask Claude to analyze your codebase:

```xml
<task>Analyze codebase for team standards</task>

<repository>
<path>~/your-workspace</path>
<stack>TypeScript, Angular, NestJS</stack>
</repository>

<find_patterns>
<typescript>
Files: libs/**/*.ts, apps/**/*.ts
- Strict mode settings
- 'any' usage frequency
- Naming conventions (files, classes, functions)
</typescript>

<angular>
Files: libs/*/feature/**/*.component.ts
- Change detection strategies
- Component patterns
</angular>
</find_patterns>
```

**What happens:**
- Claude scans hundreds of files in minutes
- Shows what you already do 85% of the time
- Provides real examples from YOUR codebase
- Highlights inconsistencies worth discussing

**What doesn't happen:**
- AI doesn't tell you what to do
- No generic "best practices" from the internet
- No decisions made without your input

This is discovery, not dictation.

### Step 2: Team Discusses (The Important Part)

Review findings together. Ask questions only humans can answer:

- Do we want this pattern everywhere?
- Are there valid exceptions?
- What helps new teammates most?
- Does this align with our values?

Vote. Decide. Document your reasoning.

AI surfaced the pattern. Humans made the call.

### Step 3: Codify Human Decisions

Now tell Claude what you agreed on. Claude outputs the structure. You review, edit, add context only humans know.

The file represents human decisions, not AI preferences.

---

## The Trust Factor

Some developers worry AI replaces them. Show them this instead.

**What AI does:**
- Scans 1000 files in seconds
- Calculates consistency percentages
- Finds patterns across repos
- Generates documentation structure

**What humans do:**
- Decide which patterns matter
- Provide context and rationale
- Make judgment calls on exceptions
- Own the standards
- Override when context requires

AI makes tedious work fast. Humans make creative decisions.

That's collaboration, not replacement.

---

## Responsible AI in Practice

This workflow demonstrates human-in-the-loop AI:

- **Human-in-the-loop**: Team decides, AI assists
- **Transparency**: Standards visible, documented, versioned in git
- **Accountability**: Your team owns the rules, not AI
- **Opt-in**: Developers can override when context requires
- **Collaboration**: Built together, not imposed by mandate

AI doesn't replace code review. It removes the tedious parts so reviewers focus on what matters: logic, architecture, edge cases.

The creative work stays human.

---

## What Changes (And What Doesn't)

**Before skill files:**
- 3-hour meetings about naming
- Same PR comments repeated forever
- Onboarding takes weeks
- Standards drift silently
- Knowledge trapped in senior dev heads

**After skill files:**
- Standards discovered in 30 minutes
- Claude handles repetitive guidance
- New devs learn patterns immediately
- Standards enforce themselves
- Knowledge documented and shared

**What changed:** Tedious work automated.

**What didn't:** Human creativity, judgment, decision-making.

Your team gets time back. You spend it on problems that need human insight.

---

## No More 3-Hour Meetings

Next time someone says "We should standardize this":

Don't schedule a meeting. Don't create another wiki page. Don't write another Notion doc nobody will read.

Ask Claude to find your patterns. Discuss what matters. Codify your decisions. Ship it.

Your team already has standards. You just made them visible.

And that 3-hour meeting? It took 30 minutes. And actually resulted in documentation people use.

Build with care. Ship with purpose.
