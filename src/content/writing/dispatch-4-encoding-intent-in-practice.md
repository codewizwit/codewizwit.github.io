This site was built with AI.

And if someone calls that "vibe coding," I need them to know: there were zero vibes involved. Every decision was intentional. Every standard was encoded before the AI touched a single file. This was built with AI the way you'd build with any collaborator: by telling it who you are, how you work, and what quality looks like before it writes anything.

That process has a name. I call it **Encoding Intent**.

## The premise

Encoding Intent is the methodology inside [The Lift](/frameworks/the-lift), the AI adoption framework I built for teams navigating this transition. The core idea is simple: plan first, prompt second.

Before AI writes a single line of code, it needs to understand your voice, your standards, your patterns, and the decisions you've already made. The more you encode upfront, the less you fix later.

This site is the proof.

## What I built before I built anything

I use Claude Code as my primary development tool. Claude Code supports something called [**skill files**](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills): markdown documents that define how the AI should behave in specific contexts. Think of them as instruction sets. Not prompts. Not vibes. Structured intent.

Before I wrote a single component for codewizwit.com, I built 15 skill files across three categories:

### Voice and brand

- **Brand Voice** encodes my philosophy: center people, critique systems, and always come back to who the work is for. It includes writing samples so the AI learns my rhythm and voice, plus tone rules, content types, formatting standards, and closing signatures for every article format.
- **Brand Style Guide** is the visual identity system for codewizwit: the cream and gold palette, Lora for headings, Inter for body, the spacing rhythm, component patterns, and the visual personality. Every design decision lives here so there's consistency across every touchpoint, whether it's this site, a slide deck, or a social post.
- **Professional Skills** captures positioning, bio variants, and content guidelines for different contexts: conferences, LinkedIn, cover letters, elevator pitches.

### Engineering standards

- **TypeScript Expert** enforces type safety patterns, strict mode, and modern TS features.
- **Engineering Practices** covers SOLID principles, clean code, and testing strategies.
- **Testing Automation** defines how I approach Playwright, Jest, and E2E pipeline design.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** documents GitHub Actions patterns, secrets management, and deployment strategies.
- **Accessibility First** is the non-negotiable. WCAG standards, semantic HTML, ARIA patterns, keyboard navigation. No human left behind means no human left out of the interface.

### Domain expertise

- **Responsible AI Governance** encodes human-in-the-loop patterns, accountability frameworks, and developer-first AI tooling principles.
- **Developer Experience** covers CLI design, documentation, developer empathy, and building tools that people actually want to use.
- **Angular + Nx**, **NestJS**, **AWS Serverless**, **Micro-Frontends** capture patterns from my professional work that inform how I think about architecture.

That's the environment. That's what the AI knows before it starts.

## What this looks like in practice

Here's a section from my brand voice skill file. This is what the AI reads before it writes anything as me:

```markdown
## Voice Characteristics

### Working-Class Intellect
Smart doesn't have to sound elite.
- Speak like a builder, not a boardroom
- Use everyday metaphors (hot dogs, hardware stores, IKEA manuals)
  to make abstract ideas stick
- Show that intellect can wear work boots

### Playfully Serious
Serious ideas land harder with spark.
- Use wit and wordplay to humanize complex ideas
- Bring in small personal stories or cultural nods
- Lightness makes the heavy stuff memorable
```

And from the style guide:

```markdown
## Color Palette
- Cream (#F5F3EE): primary background, warmth and approachability
- Black (#1A1A1A): text and contrast, grounding
- Gold (#C8973E): accent, energy and intention
```

Constraints are what make AI useful instead of generic.

## The meta-proof

This dispatch was written using the same skill files it describes. The brand voice skill shaped the tone. The style guide informed the layout. The engineering practices skill influenced how the content collection was structured.

That's the loop. Encode what you know. Let AI build inside the structure. Review what it produces against the standards you set. Repeat.

AI didn't come up with my human-centered philosophy, or decide to use Lora for the headings, or make accessibility a non-negotiable. I did. The AI executed that intent consistently across every page, every component, every article. That's the value.

## Why this matters

Most conversations about AI and code focus on speed. How fast can you ship? How many lines per hour?

The better question: how much of your judgment survives the process?

If you prompt without intent, you get generic output that kind of works but doesn't feel like yours. If you encode your standards, your voice, your values into the environment first, the AI becomes an extension of your craft instead of a replacement for it.

That's the difference between using AI and building with AI.

That's Encoding Intent.
